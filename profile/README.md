## Short introduction
Hey there :wave:

azusagawa.it is an organization entirely run by one person that specializing in back-end development; we can do front-end development as well, primarily using programming languages such as JavaScript and TypeScript.

Our motto is to use as few as possible dependencies in projects; this means that most of the time, we are trying to create our implementation of most used packages by us. A good example will be our implementation of [web server](https://github.com/Azusagawa-it/core-ts/tree/main/core_modules/azusagawa%40web-server)* using native HTTP/HTTPS module or implementation of [web socket server](https://github.com/Azusagawa-it/core-ts/tree/main/core_modules/azusagawa%40websocket)*.

* As of the moment of typing this, the web server and web socket are fully closed source; there is a possibility it will change in future.

You freely contact us if you want to order the creation of a back-end or front-end for your application, but we can as well create for you a desktop application using [Electron](https://electronjs.org/)
