## Short introduction
Hey there :wave:

Azusagawa.it is a one-person organization specializing in back-end development, but we can also do front-end development using languages such as JavaScript and TypeScript.

Our philosophy is to use as few dependencies as possible in our projects, so we often try to create our own versions of commonly-used packages. For example, we have created our own [web server](https://github.com/Azusagawa-it/core-ts/tree/main/core_modules/azusagawa%40web-server)* and [web socket server](https://github.com/Azusagawa-it/core-ts/tree/main/core_modules/azusagawa%40websocket)*.

* which are currently closed source, but may become open source in the future,
* used modules are native HTTP/HTTPS.

If you need a back-end or front-end for your application, or even a desktop application using Electron, please don't hesitate to contact us.
